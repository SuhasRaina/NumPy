# NumPy
NumPy is a Python library that provides a simple yet powerful data structure: the n-dimensional array. This is the foundation on which almost all the power of Python’s data science toolkit is built, and learning NumPy is the first step on any Python data scientist’s journey. This tutorial will provide you with the knowledge you need to use NumPy and the higher-level libraries that rely on it.
